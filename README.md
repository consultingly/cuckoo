Cuckoo: A plug-and-play, decentralised local internet for when the real one goes down.

Cuckoo is a lightweight Android app that lets you create a self-sustaining local internet without external infrastructure. Whether you're off-grid, in a disaster zone, or just building a local network, Cuckoo helps you stay connected.

🌍 Why Cuckoo?

✅ No internet? No problem. Cuckoo runs entirely on local WiFi.
✅ Self-contained mesh network – any Android phone can become a node.
✅ Built for resilience – share it via USB, no online setup required.
✅ Works on old phones – give your unused devices a second life.
✅ Simple setup – choose between Server, Node, or Viewer roles.
✅ Auto-connects users – browse local sites, share files, and chat without the web.

🔧 How It Works

Cuckoo turns Android devices into:

📡 Servers – Host a local WiFi network, web pages, and a DNS server.
📡 Nodes – Extend the range of the mesh by repeating the signal.
📡 Viewers – Connect to the network and browse local content.

Users can select their role when launching the app:
🖥️ Server: Runs WiFi hotspot, local web, and DNS.

📡 Node: Extends the network but doesn’t host content.
📱 Viewer: Connects to the network as a user.

Once set up, devices auto-connect to the nearest Cuckoo Mesh, forming a completely decentralized intranet.

📲 Getting Started

1️⃣ Install the App
🔹 Download and install Cuckoo.apk on your Android device.

2️⃣ Choose Your Role
🔹 Open the app and select Server, Node, or Viewer.

3️⃣ Start Your Local Network
🔹 If running a Server, start the WiFi hotspot and web server.
🔹 If running a Node, it will auto-extend the mesh.
🔹 Viewers can connect and access local sites (news.local).

🛠️ Technical Features

WiFi Hotspot: Creates an ad-hoc network (LocalMesh-X).
Local Web Server: Serves content (news.local).
Local DNS Server: Resolves .local domains.
Mesh Extension: Nodes auto-connect to expand coverage.
Persistent Role Selection: Devices remember their last role.
USB-Deployable: Share the APK offline, no internet needed.

📡 Real-World Use Cases

🔸 Disaster Response – Deploy a resilient local network where the internet is down.🔸 Off-Grid Communities – Provide local access to news, chat, and file sharing.🔸 Privacy-Focused Networks – Communicate without external servers.🔸 Local Events & Festivals – Set up a temporary offline info hub.🔸 Mesh Networking Research – Experiment with peer-to-peer connectivity.

🚀 Next Steps

We’re actively developing Cuckoo! Future plans include:
🔹 Encrypted messaging (like Briar but mesh-based).
🔹 Auto-discovery of nearby nodes.
🔹 Offline map hosting and document sharing.
🔹 Improved mesh routing protocols.
