### **A decentralized local internet that thrives when the world goes silent.**

SPOR: Scalable Peer Organised Routing

SPOR is a lightweight cross-platform application that lets you create a **self-sustaining local internet** without external infrastructure. Whether you're **off-grid, in a disaster zone, or just building a local network**, SPOR helps you stay connected.

## 🌍 **Why SPOR?**
✅ **No internet? No problem.** SPOR runs entirely on local WiFi.
✅ **Self-contained mesh network** – any device can become a node.
✅ **Built for resilience** – share it via USB, no online setup required.
✅ **Works on old phones, laptops, and Raspberry Pi** – give your unused devices a second life.
✅ **Simple setup** – choose between **Server, Node, or Viewer** roles.
✅ **Auto-connects users** – browse local sites, share files, and chat without the web.

## 🔧 **Supported Platforms**
SPOR works on multiple platforms:

📱 **Android:** Runs as a self-contained mesh node or server.
💻 **Windows:** `.exe` version for easy installation on laptops/PCs.
🍏 **macOS:** CLI-based setup for MacBooks and desktops.
🐧 **Raspberry Pi (Linux):** Turns a Pi into a full-featured local server.

Users can select their **role** when launching the app:
- **🖥️ Server:** Runs WiFi hotspot, local web, and DNS.
- **📡 Node:** Extends the network but doesn’t host content.
- **📱 Viewer:** Connects to the network as a user.

Once set up, devices auto-connect to the nearest **SPOR Mesh**, forming a **completely decentralized intranet**.

## 📲 **Getting Started**
### **1️⃣ Install the App**
🔹 Download and install `SPOR.apk` on Android or the `.exe` for Windows/macOS/Linux.

### **2️⃣ Choose Your Role**
🔹 Open the app and select **Server, Node, or Viewer**.

### **3️⃣ Start Your Local Network**
🔹 If running a **Server**, start the WiFi hotspot and web server.
🔹 If running a **Node**, it will auto-extend the mesh.
🔹 Viewers can connect and access local sites (`nest.local`).

## 🛠️ **Technical Features**
- **WiFi Hotspot:** Creates an ad-hoc network (`Cuckoo`).
- **Local Web Server:** Serves content (`nest.local`).
- **Local DNS Server:** Resolves `.local` domains.
- **Mesh Extension:** Nodes auto-connect to expand coverage.
- **Persistent Role Selection:** Devices remember their last role.
- **USB-Deployable:** Share the APK or `.exe` offline, no internet needed.

## 📡 **Real-World Use Cases**
🔸 **Disaster Response** – Deploy a resilient local network where the internet is down.  
🔸 **Off-Grid Communities** – Provide local access to news, chat, and file sharing.  
🔸 **Privacy-Focused Networks** – Communicate without external servers.  
🔸 **Local Events & Festivals** – Set up a temporary offline info hub.  
🔸 **Mesh Networking Research** – Experiment with peer-to-peer connectivity.

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
We’re actively developing Cuckoo! Future plans include:
- 🔹 **Encrypted messaging** (like Briar but mesh-based).
- 🔹 **Auto-discovery of nearby nodes.**
- 🔹 **Offline map hosting and document sharing.**
- 🔹 **Improved mesh routing protocols.**
